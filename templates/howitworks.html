        <h2>üõ†Ô∏è How SkillSahyog Works</h2>
        <h3>üîπ Step-by-Step Guide to Your First Skill Exchange</h3>
        <p><h4>1. Create Your Account</h4>
            Sign up on SkillSahyog with your email address and basic details.
             Your account will allow you to showcase your skills and connect with others in the community.</p>
        <p><h4>2. Complete Your Profile</h4>
            Add your profile picture, a short bio, location, and list the skills you can offer or want to learn.
             The more detailed your profile, the easier it is to match with the right users.</p>
        <p><h4>3. Browse or Search for Skills</h4>
            Explore available skills by going to the <a href="{% url 'match_skill' %}">Skill Matching</a> page.
            You can search user by choosing the skill from the dropdown you want help with
        and a list of users sorted based on AI algorithm will be displayed to you.</p>
        <p><h4>4. Send an Exchange Request</h4>
            Once you find a match, send an exchange request by going to their profile.
            Also keep in mind it is recommended to send request to only verified users.
             For example, you can offer Python help in exchange for Cloud computing.</p>
        <p><h4>5. Chat & Collaborate</h4>
            When your request is accepted, a private chatroom will be created for both of you.
            You can access you chatroom from your dashboard.
            Use this space to discuss schedules and learn from each other.</p>
        <p><h4>6. Complete the Exchange & Leave Feedback</h4>
            Once your exchange is complete, leave a rating and feedback for your partner.
            An automatic AI generated score will be assigned to both of you based on the
            ratings you have received.The feedback system helps maintain trust and improves user rankings.</p>

        <h2>‚ùìFrequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>üìå What kinds of skills can I exchange?</h3>
        <p>You can exchange any kind of skill ‚Äî from gardening and teaching to coding or digital marketing.
             If you don‚Äôt see your skill listed, go to <a href="{% url 'manage_skills' %}">Manage Skill</a> in your dashboard and request it to be added.</p>
        <h3>üí∏ Is there any payment involved?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely not ‚Äî SkillSahyog is completely free to use for the first few exchanges. We believe in building a community that thrives on mutual skill-sharing rather than money or time-credits.
            That said, to ensure fair usage and support platform sustainability,
             we may introduce a nominal subscription fee in the future for users who exceed a certain number of exchanges.
             Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî basic access and initial exchanges will always remain free for everyone.</p>
        <h3>üß© What happens if someone doesn't complete the exchange?</h3>
        <p>An exchange is only completed after both users submit their ratings and reviews.
             Until then, the chatroom stays active. Only after feedback from both sides is the skill score calculated.</p>
        <h3>‚ùå Can I reject an exchange request?</h3>
        <p>Yes! If you're not interested or available, 
            just click the "Reject" button on your dashboard next to the exchange request.</p>
        <h3>üìà How does the rank and score system work?</h3>
        <p>Your profile rank and score are calculated using:<br>
            1. Skill Demand: How many times your skill is requested by others.<br>
            2. User Ratings: Feedback you receive from successful exchanges. Together, they help others see your credibility and popularity on the platform.</p>
        <h3>‚ùì How can I verify my account?</h3>
        <p>To verify your account, go to the <a href="{% url 'account_settings' %}">Settings</a> page and request an OTP (One-Time Password).
             The OTP will be sent to your registered email address. Enter it to complete the verification process.
            <strong>‚úÖ Why verify?</strong> Verified users have a higher chance of their exchange requests being accepted by others</p>
        <h3>‚ùì How can I get support or ask for help?</h3>
        <p>If you need help or want to share feedback, simply fill out the contact form available at the bottom of the Features page.
             The SkillSahyog team will get back to you shortly.</p>
